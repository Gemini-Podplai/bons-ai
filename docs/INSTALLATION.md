## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to connect to Google AI Studio"
- **Problem**: API key is invalid or expired
- **Solution**: Regenerate API key in Google AI Studio
- **Prevention**: Set up API key rotation in your calendar

#### "Vertex AI quota exceeded"  
- **Problem**: Used up free credits or hit rate limits
- **Solution**: Check billing in Google Cloud Console
- **Prevention**: Set up billing alerts

#### "Scrapybara instance unavailable"
- **Problem**: No available instances or account suspended
- **Solution**: Check Scrapybara dashboard for instance status
- **Prevention**: Monitor usage in Scrapybara dashboard

#### "Memory allocation error"
